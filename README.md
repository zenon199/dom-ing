# 🐱 DOM Practice – Mini Projects for JS Interviews

Welcome to the **DOM-ing** repository! This collection contains small, focused projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to improve your understanding of the **Document Object Model (DOM)** and strengthen your **JavaScript** skills.

## 📌 Purpose

- Sharpen practical JavaScript & DOM manipulation skills
- Understand common front-end patterns asked in interviews
- Build mini projects with a focus on **logic, interactivity**, and **clean code**
- Practice debugging and DOM traversal techniques

## 🚀 What's Inside

Each folder contains a **self-contained project**, including:

- 📄 `index.html` – HTML structure  
- 🎨 `style.css` – Styling (optional for some logic-based projects)  
- ⚙️ `script.js` – JavaScript logic focusing on DOM manipulation
